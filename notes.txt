* In the old Gato, the parent organization was stored as collegeLink->name and collegeLink->url.  This doesn't work
  with the new yaml configuration because "name" is what they use to create the content node that the properties go under.
  So if you set the name and url to be "my department" and "my url", it would create my-department->"my department" and 
  my-department->"my url" instead of putting the properties under collegeLink.
  
* I renamed the collegeLink node "parentOrganization" and it has 2 properties: parent_name and url.



QUESTIONS:

* Where can the super-user menu items be stored?  I don't think they can come from a YAML file.
Where can we put them in the JCR so that every page can read them and only a handful of people
can edit them?

* The Texas State logos in the header and footer need to be stored in some common image location.  
Also, we need to figure out how to put them there.  

* Right now, the scss files that make the gato.css file are not in git.  Where should they go?
Magnolia has an SCSS module https://wiki.magnolia-cms.com/display/WIKI/SCSS+Module but it doesn't
seem to work with 5.4 yet.  

* Where should the header images come from?  Can departments use their own image or just images
provided by marketing?  

* I had trouble getting around the fact that 'global' variables I set in the template were available
in includes, but not in areas.

* What happens if the user builds their whole page with no sidebar, using all four columns and then 
decides that they want a sidebar?
